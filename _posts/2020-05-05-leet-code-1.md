Since this is my first problem solving post, I wanted to start with the first question at [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). 

#### 1. [<span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) (Easy) </span>

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

**Solution**

What I think ? 

* Straight-forward solution can be done by checking every possible number couple. The time complexity would be O$($N$^2$).

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
                       
```



```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = dict()
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if str(target-nums[i]) in seen:
                return [i, seen.get(str(target-nums[i]))]
            else:
                key = str(nums[i])
                seen[key] = i
```
