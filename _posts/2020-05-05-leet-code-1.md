Since this is my first problem solving post, I wanted to start with the first question at leetcode. 

#### 1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">(Easy) </span>

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

**Solution**

What I think ? 

* Straight-forward solution can be done by checking every possible number couple. The time complexity would be O(N^2) where N is length of the given list.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        if len(nums) < 2:
            return []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]                  
```
* I think this can be done better than O(N^2). How?

* Actually, we can check if complement of a number exists in the list. Since target - num = complement, for each number we can check if the complement is in the list. However this is still O(N^2) because searching for a number in the list is O(N). Maybe it can be improved ? 

* We can use a map or dictionary to store the numbers and their indexes in the list. We can insert all numbers into a map, then we can check every number if it's complement exists. The time complexity would be O(N) however we need to use extra O(N) memory for the map.

* Actually, we can even do this in one-pass. We can store the numbers when we see them if the complement is not in the map. 

* We need to use the numbers as the keys of the dictionary and indexes as values. So we need to convert numbers into map keys which are string.

**Final Implementation:**

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = dict()
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = str(target-nums[i])
            if complement in seen:
                return [i, seen.get(complement)]
            else:
                key = str(nums[i])
                seen[key] = i
```
