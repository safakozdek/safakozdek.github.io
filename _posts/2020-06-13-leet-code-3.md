This is a very common question with a lot of versions. I had this kind of questions in different interviews. I thought that it would be nice to analyze the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" series of Leetcode. Let's start with the first one.

#### 1. [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/) <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">(Easy) </span>

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most **one** transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.  
Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Solution**

* If we had infinite number of transaction we would want to get advantage of every possible profitable transaction. However we are only permitted to complete one transaction. So, we need to find the best possible transaction times to buy and sell.

* A really dumb way of doing this might be checking every possible couple of days for a transaction and take the one with the highest profit. It would take O(n^2) time complexity which is not quite nice.

* Since we need to buy the stock before selling it, we might assume that we bought it on the first day and start traversing the array from the start. If we see a higher value than our buying price, we check the possible profit by abstracting the buying price from the current one. We can store the maximum profit in a variable and update it whenever we see a higher profit. 

* Also when we see a lower price than our buying price, we can update the buying price. Since we saw a lower price, for the next values it is safe for us to assume that we will be buying on this current day.

**Final Implementation:**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) < 2:
            return 0
        
        mx = 0
        start = prices[0]
        
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > start:
                val = prices[i] - start
                if val > mx:
                    mx = val
            elif prices[i] < start:
                start = prices[i]
        
        return mx
```

#### 2. [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/) <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">(Easy) </span>

Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete **as many transactions as you like** (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.  
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.  
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Solution**

* This time we have a chance to make as many transaction as we like. So it means that we should be considering multiple transactions.

* At first you might think that sell our stock whenever we see a higher price than our buying price since we have unlimited transactions.  For this reason, example 3 is actually a great example. Consider buying at 1 then selling at 2, then buying at 3 again and selling at 4. This ends up with a lower profit.

* As you can understand from the third example, we should be buying at the start of an increasing sequence and selling at the end of the sequence. Also, we should be doing this for all increasing sequences.

* As in the first question, since we need to buy the stock before selling it, we might assume that we bought it on the first day and start traversing the array from the start. If we see a higher value than our buying price, it is guaranteed that we will have a profit.

* Whenever we see a higher price, rather than selling right away we check the next value, if it is a bigger value we continue with that since we are trying to reach to the end of the increasing sequence.

* Whenever we see a lower price than our last buying price it means that we are at the end of the increasing sequence, so we can just update our profit now. Then we check for the next increasing sequence.

**Final Implementation:**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 0:
            return 0
        
        profit = 0
        iterator = 0 
        
        while iterator < len(prices) - 1:
            while iterator < len(prices) - 1 and prices[iterator] >= prices[iterator+1]:
                iterator += 1
            buy = prices[iterator]
            
            while iterator < len(prices)-1 and prices[iterator] <= prices[iterator+1]:
                iterator += 1
            sell = prices[iterator]    
            profit += sell - buy
                
        return profit
```
