### LeetCode Problem Solving #1
Since this is my first problem solving post, I wanted to start with the first question at [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). 

#### 1. [<span style="color:DodgerBlue">Two Sum</span>](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) (Easy) 

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **_exactly_** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```
